# 10. Copyright

## Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement

We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any materials accessible on or from the Services infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from the Services by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512\) (“*DMCA*”), the written notice (the “*DMCA Notice*”) must include substantially the following:

* Your physical or electronic signature.
* Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works accessible through the Services, a representative list of such works.
* Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.
* Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate.
* A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity accessible through the Services is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

## Counter Notification Procedures

If you believe that material you posted through the Services was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter notification with us (a “*Counter Notice*”) by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter Notice must include substantially the following:

* Your physical or electronic signature.
* An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.
* Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).
* A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
* A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which the Services may be found) and that you will accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who provided the DMCA Notice at issue.

The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your Counter Notice.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Services was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

We may terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at least 30 days’ advance notice.

WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER, ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED BY YOU ARE UNAFFECTED BY THIS SECTION.

# 13. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST REVENUES, PROFITS CAPITAL OR OVERHEAD, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), DELICT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES, OUR LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

# 14. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us and our affiliates, successors and assigns, and each of their respective trustees, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and representatives, from and against all claims, liabilities, actions, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments, decrees, losses, expenses, damages, settlement funds, fines, penalties and associated costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to (1) your use or misuse of the Services, including any Content; (2) your breach of these Terms; (3) Materials submitted or provided to us; or (4) any use of your Materials and/or our exercise of any rights granted to us, including without limitation claims based on rights of privacy, rights of publicity, false light, defamation, copyright, patent and/or trademark infringement relating to your Materials. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this section, in which event you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.

# 15. Release of Claims

You hereby release us and our affiliates, successors and assigns, and each of their respective trustees, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and representatives from and against the full amount of all claims, liabilities, actions, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments, decrees, losses, fees, damages, settlement funds, and associated costs and expenses including attorney’s fees arising from or in connection with your use of the Services, any use of your Materials, and/or our exercise of any rights granted to us, including without limitation claims based on rights of privacy, rights of publicity, false light, defamation, copyright, patent and/or trademark infringement relating to Materials and claims for injury, loss or damage of any kind resulting from your use of any Content.

# 16. Governing Law

All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law.

# 17. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and we agree to arbitrate any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or in any way related to your use of the Services, including but not limited to claims based on contract, tort, negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions. EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO THRESHOLD ARBITRABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO WHETHER THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS UNCONSCIONABLE OR ILLUSORY AND ANY DEFENSE TO ARBITRATION. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN YOUR AND OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, NOT AS A CLASS, PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

The mutual promise by you and us to arbitrate any and all disputes, and to do so on an individual basis, rather than to litigate before the courts or other bodies, provides the mutual consideration for this agreement to arbitrate.

Either party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other party with written notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of such claims. In no event shall the request for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside by a single neutral arbitrator and in accordance with the then-current rules for resolution of disputes of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) (available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879). The parties are entitled to representation by an attorney or other representative of their choosing. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall issue the award in writing and therein state the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.

If this arbitration clause is held unenforceable or arbitration is for any other reason not available, any disputes under this Agreement shall be heard in a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.

# 18. General Terms

You are an independent contractor and nothing contained herein shall create an employment or agency relationship, a joint venture, or a partnership. No failure to enforce these Terms shall constitute a waiver of any provision contained herein. To the extent any portion of these Terms is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such portion will be modified solely to the extent necessary to cause such portion to be enforceable, and these Terms, as modified, will remain in full force and effect. This is the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter herein.

# 19. Electronic Communications

These Terms and any other documentation, agreements, notices, or communications between you and us are provided to you electronically. You consent to receive these electronic communications and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically, via email and on the Services, satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. Please print or otherwise save a copy of all documentation, agreements, notices, and other communications for your reference.
